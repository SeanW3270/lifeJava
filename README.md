# LifeJava

A Java-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life, demonstrating key principles of cellular automata, algorithmic efficiency, and software design.

## Project Overview
This project provides an interactive and configurable simulation of the Game of Life, allowing users to specify initial conditions and customize execution parameters.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:
- **Java** (JDK 17 or later)
- **Maven** (for dependency management and testing)
- **JUnit 5** (for unit testing)
- **Mockito** (for unit test mocking)

Check your Java installation with:
```sh
java -version
```

## Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository using:
```sh
git clone <repository-url>
cd lifeJava
```

## Building the Project
### Using Maven (Recommended)
```sh
mvn clean compile
```
### Using Java Compiler
```sh
javac -d target/classes src/main/java/com/example/*.java
```

## Running the Simulation
After compiling, run the game with:
```sh
java -cp target/classes com.example.GameOfLife <path-to-input-file>
```
Example:
```sh
java -cp target/classes com.example.GameOfLife examples/test_data.txt
```

## Input File Format
Input files should be formatted in Life 1.06 format:
```
#Life 1.06
0 1
1 2
2 0
2 1
2 2
```
Each line represents a living cell with its x and y coordinates.

## Configuration Options
During execution, you will be prompted to configure:
1. **Print cell coordinates** - Display living cell positions after each generation.
2. **Print grid representation** - Show a visual representation of the simulation grid.
3. **Show execution time** - Display the runtime for each generation.

Enter `y` (yes) or `n` (no) when prompted.

## Running Tests
Run tests using Maven:
```sh
mvn test
```
Or build and test:
```sh
mvn clean install
```

## Functional Breakdown
### getNeighbors(Cell cell)
Returns all living and dead neighboring positions of a given cell.

### getNextGeneration(Set<Cell> currentGeneration)
Computes the next state of the grid based on:
- A living cell with **2 or 3 neighbors** survives.
- A dead cell with **exactly 3 neighbors** becomes alive.
- A living cell with **fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors** dies.

### runGenerations(int generations, Set<Cell> startingGeneration, GameConfig config)
- Iterates through multiple generations.
- Calls helper functions for debugging and visualization.

## Helper Functions
### printGenerations(Set<Cell> cells)
Prints a textual representation of the current generation.

### printGenerationGrid(Set<Cell> cells)
Displays a structured grid of the current generation.

### printGameRuntime(long startTime)
Calculates and prints execution time per generation.

### validateGameInputs(int generations, Set<Cell> startingGeneration, GameConfig config)
Ensures that input values are valid before running the simulation.

## .gitignore Setup
Ensure compiled files and build artifacts are excluded from Git commits:
```
target/
*.class
```
